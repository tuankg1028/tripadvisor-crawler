## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AdsPower Connection Failed**
   - Ensure AdsPower is running
   - Check the API URL and port
   - Verify group ID exists
   - Try different browser profile

2. **No Reviews Found**
   - Verify the TripAdvisor URL is correct (Hotel_Review or Attraction_Review)
   - Check if the page structure has changed
   - Ensure the page has reviews (not just photos/Q&A)
   - Try clearing cache: `npm run scrape cache clear <url>`

3. **Browser Launch Failed**
   - Check AdsPower profile status
   - Ensure sufficient system resources
   - Try creating a new profile
   - Restart AdsPower application

4. **Extraction Errors**
   - Page structure may have changed - check debug output
   - Some elements might be loading slowly - increase delays
   - Captcha or rate limiting detected - wait and retry

5. **Cache Issues**
   - Cache files stored in `./cache/` directory
   - Use cache commands to inspect and manage
   - Clear specific URL cache if data seems outdated

### Debug Mode

Set environment variable for verbose logging:
```bash
